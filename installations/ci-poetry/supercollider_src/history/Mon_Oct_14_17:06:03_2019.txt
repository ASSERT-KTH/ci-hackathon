late script...
Link me to the right place
we occupy pixels on a screen
slippery network
the people are not
Where did it go?
             my interface
Still seeking a possible
As we move on,
memory

[]
in a bit
             is a portal to me, to my being
Clocked in and out
and found each other again
for the sovereign to exert its power
What can I not access?
Swiftly erases the wrongs
before scope
