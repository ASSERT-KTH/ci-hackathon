                what am i?

My hand across my keyboard
                    my body


Swiftly erases the wrongs
                to feel, to breathe
What wrongs
      lost.
        transparent
encounters in the shadow
change is action
What do they know that I do not?
beyond the limit

Swiftly erases the wrongs
it seeps into the 

What is the inbetween
A loud silence
                pain
