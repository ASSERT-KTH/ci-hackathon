What do they know that I do not?
Not an object
What wrongs
an all-seeing eye gazes
Learn and unlearn and relearn
continuous integration
An error in my path
unattainable, the sun
Ticking
Clocked in and out
My hand across my keyboard
What do they know that I do not?
What rights
Not a thing
Who decides?

waking up    ,
Who decides?
What rights
Who decides?
Not a subject
What wrongs
Not a thing
The present and the past
