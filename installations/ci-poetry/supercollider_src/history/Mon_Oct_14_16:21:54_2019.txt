we occupy pixels on a screen
we walk among

                reduced,

                            blends in
                to feel, to breathe
within
                pain
                what am i?
what one is
a stepping stone
the people are not
        beyond the flesh and bones
it seeps into the 
is it not real?
little did we know


the people are not
the people are not
             my interface
what a coincidence, it could not be
        transparent
