                            blends in
                what am i?
What can I not access?
the touch of a fern
Not an object
vast expanse
thunderclap
stemming from the inner
state change -
sitting on a patch of moss
hive; network
What do they know that I do not?
a slower pace
soft --- ware
drifting into the night
at an increasing rate
feather
             is a portal to me, to my being

worn out
change is action

soft --- ware
- change cannot be requested
