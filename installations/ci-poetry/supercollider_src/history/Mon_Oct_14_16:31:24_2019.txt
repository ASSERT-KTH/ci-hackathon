    i am defined

                    if
    a whole
                zeros   and     ones
                    i am not 0
within
                pain

    either or
a stepping stone

        beyond the flesh and bones
            
Link me to the right place
What do they know that I do not?


the people are not
the people are not
Our footsteps in the snow
what a coincidence, it could not be
A loud silence
