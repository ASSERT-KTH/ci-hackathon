Clocked in and out

                love


             is a portal to me, to my being

                to feel, to breathe

What can I not access?
.     .

A loud silence
Ticking

                zeros   and     ones
        incomplete

is it not real?
Ticking

I went down to the water
What is the inbetween
Connect and concatenate
