state change -
Giving form to
realising
waking up    ,
                pain
             is a portal to me, to my being



             my interface
hive; network

            there is an and
      to get past -
        beyond the flesh and bones


                reduced,
      in your shoulders?
oxygen expelled

Occupy/evacuate
What is the inbetween
what one is
