what a coincidence, it could not be
eternal growth - infinite
on the list
what a coincidence, it could not be
for the sovereign to exert its power
                    i am not 0
            
Not an object
this is because
access

As we move on,
it tends to never slow,
Not a user
what do you seek?
it tends to never slow,
And I knew
Clocked in and out
and then she realized
for the sovereign to exert its power
we occupy pixels on a screen
Swiftly erases the wrongs
or is it something in the middle?
