we occupy pixels on a screen
we walk among
black
transparent
the people are not
                pain
what one is
within
                pain
                what am i?
change is action
a stepping stone
?Â¿
        invisible
it seeps into the 
    the computer of the future
little did we know
        transparent

we were told that worse things
*.*.+..
amongst petals fallen
what a coincidence, it could not be
        transparent
