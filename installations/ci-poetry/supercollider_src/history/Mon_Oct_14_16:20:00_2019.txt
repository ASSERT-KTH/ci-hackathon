we occupy pixels on a screen
we walk among
black
transparent

it seeps into the 
what one is
within
                pain
                what am i?
what one is
a stepping stone
?Â¿
        beyond the flesh and bones
it seeps into the 
    the computer of the future
little did we know
        transparent

        beyond the flesh and bones
*.*.+..
amongst petals fallen
what a coincidence, it could not be
        transparent
