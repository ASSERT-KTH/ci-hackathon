what a coincidence, it could not be
eternal growth - infinite
new materials,

for the sovereign to exert its power
                    i am not 0
            
                pain
this is because
access

As we move on,
it tends to never slow,

of the narrative of industrialization
it tends to never slow,
And I knew

what this environment represents
for the sovereign to exert its power
Giving form to
for the sovereign to exert its power
or is it something in the middle?
