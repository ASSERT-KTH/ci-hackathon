                            blends in
is it not real?
                pain
of the narrative of industrialization
                            exceeds the space


                    my body
      a life anew
A loud silence
Clocked in and out
imaginary tools
Fleets, more graspable
Link me to the right place
      outside in
-- -- --
Link me to the right place
in a bit
                what am i?
      outside in
        i overflow
Clocked in and out
