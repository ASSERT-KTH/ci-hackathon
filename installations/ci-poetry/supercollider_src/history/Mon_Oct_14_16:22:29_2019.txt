we occupy pixels on a screen
we walk among

                    if

                            blends in
                    i am not 0
within
                pain

                    
a stepping stone

        beyond the flesh and bones
it seeps into the 
Link me to the right place
What do they know that I do not?


the people are not
the people are not
             my interface
what a coincidence, it could not be
A loud silence
