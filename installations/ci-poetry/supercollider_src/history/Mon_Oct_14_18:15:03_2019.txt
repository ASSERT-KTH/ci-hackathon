state change -
                to feel, to breathe
realising
waking up    ,
                pain
             is a portal to me, to my being



it seeps into the 
hive; network

            there is an and
      to get past -



                reduced,
      in your shoulders?
oxygen expelled

Occupy/evacuate
        beyond the flesh and bones
what one is
