grasp
oxygen expelled
¨¨.¨¨
cascading
the people are not
unattainable, the sun
You escape
network
that the time was upon us
                software
transport
***
the people are not
it seeps into the 
                what am i?
                pain

a slower pace
program
a breath of what
    true or false
the dawn and the dusk
state change -
drifting into the night
