                what am i?

My hand across my keyboard
                    my body


Swiftly erases the wrongs
                to feel, to breathe
What wrongs
      lost.
        transparent
encounters in the shadow
Data surround
What do they know that I do not?
Link me to the right place

Swiftly erases the wrongs
it seeps into the 
What is the inbetween
What is the inbetween
A loud silence
                pain
