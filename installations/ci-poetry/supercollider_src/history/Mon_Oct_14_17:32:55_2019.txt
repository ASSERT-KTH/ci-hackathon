there:
What wrongs

My hand across my keyboard
                    my body


Swiftly erases the wrongs
Clocked in and out
What wrongs
      lost.
        transparent
encounters in the shadow
My hand across my keyboard
What do they know that I do not?
beyond the limit
Ticking
Swiftly erases the wrongs
Not a thing

What is the inbetween
A loud silence
