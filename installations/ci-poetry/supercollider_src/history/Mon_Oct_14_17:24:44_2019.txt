What do they know that I do not?
a manifesto for
before scope
an all-seeing eye gazes
boot
continuous integration
What rights
unattainable, the sun
Ticking
      inside out
My hand across my keyboard
What do they know that I do not?
intentional bluescreen
Not a thing
The present and the past
Not an object
waking up    ,
Not a user
What do they know that I do not?
Who decides?
Data surround
What wrongs
Not a thing
