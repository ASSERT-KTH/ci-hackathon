we walk among

What rights
do you know
Our footsteps in the snow
        transparent

unit
We are asked to be this way
beyond the limit
Learn and unlearn and relearn

                            blends in
I went down to the water
We are asked to be this way
What do they know that I do not?
black
What is the inbetween
And I knew
The present and the past
Not a thing
