we occupy pixels on a screen
we walk among

                reduced,

                            blends in
                to feel, to breathe
within
                pain

what one is
a stepping stone
the people are not
        beyond the flesh and bones
it seeps into the 
Link me to the right place
What do they know that I do not?


the people are not
the people are not
             my interface
what a coincidence, it could not be
A loud silence
