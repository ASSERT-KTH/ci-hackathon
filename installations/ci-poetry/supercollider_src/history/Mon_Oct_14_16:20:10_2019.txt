we occupy pixels on a screen
we walk among

transparent

it seeps into the 
                to feel, to breathe
within
                pain
                what am i?
what one is
a stepping stone
the people are not
        beyond the flesh and bones
it seeps into the 
is it not real?
little did we know


        beyond the flesh and bones
*.*.+..
amongst petals fallen
what a coincidence, it could not be
        transparent
