I have hope
within me

I saw my reflection
it could not be more blurry

we were told that worse things
have happened before

can you believe in something so true
or is it something in the middle?

little did we know
that the time was upon us

and then she realized
what a coincidence, it could not be

his heart heavy
he climbed

we turned around
and found each other again

I can breathe you in
you can sense

close to me
close to you

heavy eyes
rest your head

why do you ask?
what do you seek?
