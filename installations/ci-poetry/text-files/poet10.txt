we have shared
we walk among
I wait
encounters in the shadow
How?
Our footsteps in the snow
The shadows of our shapes
I ran
You must not see
Why?
You can believe
I went down to the water
And I knew
And finally found you
How have you decided,
Gone to the mountain
Where did it go?
When?
Because of this,
Still seeking a possible
You escape
There is a place
Giving form to
What should we do with our brain?
How can we occupy it?
We are asked to be this way
So many things at the same time
do you know
I have been told,
we wonder
we choose
we decipher
perhaps tomorrow
you will notice
within
beyond the limit
subtle encounters
do you have the answer?
I seek an answer.
there:
Where?
