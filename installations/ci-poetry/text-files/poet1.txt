transparent
        invisible
    the computer of the future
                            blends in
the people are not
        transparent
             my interface
             is a portal to me, to my being
            
what one is
        it becomes
it seeps into the 

                zeros   and     ones


        beyond the flesh and bones
                what am i?

                reduced,
                                compressed?

is it not real?
                to feel, to breathe
                pain

                love
