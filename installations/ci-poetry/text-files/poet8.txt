stemming from the inner
amongst petals fallen
oxygen expelled
a breath of what
state change -
what matter matters?
blades of grass,
I will follow, to the pine grove
the patterns of the moon, 
they cycle 
unattainable, the sun
in orbit with another
eclipsed within itself
becomes pollinated
a stray leaf
nocturnal behavior
scattered across the soil
decomposing,
mycelia - underground
the touch of a fern
sitting on a patch of moss
drifting into the night
feather
the lunar shift
a subtle rhythm in the ground 
thunderclap
to nourish the earth
the dawn and the dusk
