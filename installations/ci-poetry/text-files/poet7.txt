As we move on,
discovery
new materials,
incomplete prototypes
not-yet-possible
peopleâ€™s ideas for inventions are constrained
a major leap
a stepping stone
what is innovative anymore
eternal growth - infinite
it tends to never slow,
this changes the direction
of the narrative of industrialization
what is behind this interface,
we occupy pixels on a screen
so many things at the same time
the power to give or take
this is because
and thus configuring the world,
indeed, the memory remains
some might argue
of seeking more efficient ways
designed in a way
an all-seeing eye gazes
a plan to maximize surveillance
for the sovereign to exert its power
a public space
a manifesto for
occupy space
what this environment represents
