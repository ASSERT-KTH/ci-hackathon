decomposing,
a major leap
in inattention
people’s ideas for inventions are constrained
?¿

eternal growth - infinite
eclipsed within itself
what is innovative anymore

it was really crowded
Who decides?
on the list
a slower pace
    the computer of the future
Clocked in and out
What is the inbetween
Unlimited information
What is the inbetween
The future ignores the present
that's good
enjoy
uuuuuuuuhhhhh

            there is an and

An error in my path
What is the inbetween

                    
What can I not access?

Swifly erases the wrongs
Ticking
Nope
