- **I'm looking for partners, I'd like to create or join a team?**

  Simply create an issue on this repository and tell what you are looking for.

- **How do I add my information as a participant?**

   Yes, we also use Travis to construct this site. Basically, we walk trough our repo to catch every team and every solution by team, and then, we construct this site with the collected information. Just follow these instructions to register a team:
   1. Fork the project
   2. Create a folder inside "participants" with your team member github ids separated by underscore as a name, for example: ```id1_id2_...idn```.
   4. **Optional** Create a ```Readme.md``` file with the content that you want to show in your team page (By deafult we list your solutions and put them in an autogenerated file)
   3. Put any solution of yours in the previous folder
   5. **Options** We create a page for each solution, just create a ```Readme.md``` inside your solution folder and we will add it as a page in the site.
   6. Create a pull request to master
   7. And thats all !!.
   
- **Can I register together with a friend so we can be  on the same team?**   
   
You are very welcome to do so! Follow the instructions of previous question and create a folder named with all github ids separated by underscore

- **Where is the hackathon happening?**

  The hackathon will take place in [reaktorhallen, a.k.a R1](https://www.r1.kth.se/). This is a very special place, 25 meters underground, where Swedish researchers had an experimental nuclear reactor and investigated nuclear physics from 1954 to 1970. In 1982, the reactor was completetely dismantled. Since 1998, the place is managed by KTH and used mainly for creative events, art exhibitions and installation, seminars and movie production. Over the years, among others, Madonna (the video [Nothing Really Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAVx9RKaLPU)), Moderna Dansteatern, Cullberg Ballet, Riksteatern, Radiokören and others have used R1 for different types of artistic projects.

- **What kind of equipment can I expect?**

We will provide access to:

   - light fixtures to have a ci-art light show. [More information about lights for ci-art](https://kth.github.io/ci-hackathon/lights.html).
   - an organ that can be controlled through a MIDI API. [More information about the organ MIDI API]().
   - a big screen to display pieces that are rendered on your laptop
   - speakers to play sound ci-art pieces
   
- **Do I have to know how to program to participate to the hackathon?**

    No. You can join an existing team and it is great to do statistics and data visualization based on the dump of Travis CI builds available here: [https://zenodo.org/record/2560966](https://zenodo.org/record/2560966)
    
- **Do I have to use Travis CI?**

    No, you can use another open CI API or CI dataset. The goal is to something fun or aesthetic with continuous integration data.  

- **Is there a specific goal that should be achieved at the hackathon?**

    The main goals is that all participants participants have fun with CI data. It would be great to create something artistic based on CI (something that may be called "software art" or in this case "CI art").


- **Can I start before the hackathon’s day?**

    Of course, feel free to start before and come with cool demo on Oct 14 2019 in R1.
