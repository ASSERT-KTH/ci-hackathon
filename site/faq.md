- **I'm looking for partners, I'd like to create or join a team?**

  Simply create an issue on this repository and tell what you are looking for.

- **How do I add my information as a participant?**

   Yes, we also use Travis to construct this site. Basically, we walk trough our repo to catch every team and every solution by team, and then, we construct this site with the collected information. Just follow these instructions to register a team:
   1. Fork the project
   2. Create a folder inside "participants" with your team member github ids separated by underscore as a name, for example: ```id1_id2_...idn```.
   4. **Optional** Create a ```Readme.md``` file with the content that you want to show in your team page (By deafult we list your solutions and put them in an autogenerated file)
   3. Put any solution of yours in the previous folder
   5. **Options** We create a page for each solution, just create a ```Readme.md``` inside your solution folder and we will add it as a page in the site.
   6. Create a pull request to master
   7. And thats all !!.
