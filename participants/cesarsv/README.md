Neural style transfer is a technique used to produce artistic pictures with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  It takes two images, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style, and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the style image.

This work is inspired by [Google Deep Dream algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream). We use [Neural Style Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer) to create a representation of the travis logo based on an image.

This is the result after 1000 iterations:
