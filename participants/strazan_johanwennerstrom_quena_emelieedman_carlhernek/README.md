# Nebula
A contribution to the [KTH CI hackathon](https://kth.github.io/ci-hackathon/), the first ever CI art hackathon. The idea is to create a pulsing nebula were the size of each 'beat' is dependent och the amount of successfull commits travis registerd since last 'beat'.

## About the hackathon
### Travis CI
For this hackathon, we focus on one CI engine: Travis CI. We have selected it because it helps the developers of thousands of open source project to make sure that the changes they contribute are correct. Travis CI is literally the factory where the key components of the modern web and mobile applications are built.
### Reaktorhallen
The hackathon will take place in [reaktorhallen, a.k.a R1.](https://www.r1.kth.se/) This is a very special place, 25 meters underground, 
where Swedish researchers had an experimental nuclear reactor and investigated nuclear physics from 1954 to 1970. 
In 1982, the reactor was completetely dismantled. Since 1998, the place is managed by KTH and used mainly for creative events,
art exhibitions and installation, seminars and movie production. Over the years, among others, Madonna
[the video Nothing Really Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAVx9RKaLPU), Moderna Dansteatern, Cullberg Ballet, Riksteatern, Radiok√∂ren and others have used 
R1 for different types of artistic projects. [Read more](https://openhousestockholm.se/objekt/reaktorhallen/)
