                <h2>ABOUT</h2><br>
                <p>This is a contribution to the KTH CI hackathon, the first ever CI art hackathon to take place. Our
                    goal with this project is to show how the internet is alive and constantly pulsing with activity. We
                    have chosen to visually represent this by a pulsing nebula where the size of each 'beat' is
                    dependent on the amount of successful commits travis has registered since last 'beat'. In the
                    background you hear the sound of a heartbeat that is connected to the pulse of the nebula</p>

                    <h2>TRAVIS CI</h2><br>
                    <p>For this hackathon, we focus on one CI engine: Travis CI. We have selected it because it helps the
                        developers of thousands of open source projects to make sure that the changes they contribute are
                        correct. Travis CI is literally the factory where the key components of the modern web and mobile
                        applications are built.</p>

                        <h2>REAKTORHALLEN</h2><br>
                        <p>The hackathon will take place in reaktorhallen, a.k.a R1. This is a very special place, 25 meters
                            underground, where Swedish researchers had an experimental nuclear reactor and investigated nuclear
                            physics from 1954 to 1970. In 1982, the reactor was completetely dismantled. Since 1998, the place
                            is managed by KTH and used mainly for creative events, art exhibitions and installation, seminars
                            and movie production. Over the years, among others, Madonna the video Nothing Really Matters,
                            Moderna Dansteatern, Cullberg Ballet, Riksteatern, Radiok√∂ren and others have used R1 for different
                            types of artistic projects.</p>
