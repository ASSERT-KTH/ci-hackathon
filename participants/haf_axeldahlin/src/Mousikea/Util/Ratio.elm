{-| "Arbitrary" (up to `max_int` size) precision fractional numbers. Think of
it as the length of a rigid bar that you've constructed from a bunch of
initial bars of the same fixed length
by the operations of gluing bars together and shrinking a
given bar so that an integer number of copies of it glues together to
make another given bar.

type Rational
    = Rational Int Int


{-| The biggest number that divides both arguments (the greatest common divisor).

    if b == 0 then
        a

{-| Mulitplication. `mulitply x (c / d)` is the length of the bar that you'd get
if you glued `c` copies of a bar of length `x` end-to-end and then shrunk it
down enough so that `d` copies of the shrunken bar would fit in the big
glued bar.
