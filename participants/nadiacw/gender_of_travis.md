# The Gender of TravisCI
I'd like to create a visualization using p5.js of the gender of people appearing in the TravisCI stream. This might be quite difficult and will (unfortunately) rely on normative assumptions because the stream doesn't provide information on the user's gender. Therefore, it will have to make use of the first name of uses (for those who provide it) and search through a database of common male/female names.
The visuals will change depending on male/female/undefined users.

The aim of this project is to highlight the lack of women in computer science.

Is this even possible? If you think you can help me do this, please join! :)
