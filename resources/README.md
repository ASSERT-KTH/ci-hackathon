A collection of libraries, code examples and papers that can serve to build CI-art pieces.

## Libraries

* [Network-synchronised metronome](https://github.com/chr15m/SyncJams) a library to synchronize several device with respect to a common pulse, over wifi. Can be useful to syncrhonize the CI event and the media displays.
* [Pure Data and openGL](https://github.com/Ant1r/ofxPof). A set of Pure Data (Pd) externals written with openFrameworks API, that bring OpenGL graphics and utilities to Pd.

## CodePen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io) is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers. It includes various visual effects that can be remixed for the hackathon. Here a few curated examples

* [Rain](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/oXmgJe). This pen served as a starting point for the [CI rain](https://travis.durieux.me/rain.html).
* [Infinite tree of life](https://codepen.io/ge1doot/pen/vOQZGG)
