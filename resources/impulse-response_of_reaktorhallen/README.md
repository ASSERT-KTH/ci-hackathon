# Impulse Response from Reaktorhallen

This folder contains IR-files that replicate the natural reverberation of Reaktorhallen. To use them, open them in a convolution reverb in your DAW or creative coding environment of choice. You could use this to simulate how a sound you're planning to use will sound in the actual hall.

If you don't know which file to use, the ones in the `mono` folder are your safest bet. If your convolution reverb supports stereo IR-files, use that. If you are using ambisonics (e.g. [The Ambisonic Toolkit](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/)) you can make use of the b-format files.

N.B. Playing sound through this reverb in the actual hall will likely sound quite bad. It is more useful as a simulation tool or to recreate the sound of the hall after the event.
