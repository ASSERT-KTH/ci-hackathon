# Inspiring code and art

This is a collection of pieces of code and art that are meant to inspire the participants to the CI-art hackathon in order to build memorable artistic embodiments of continuous integration.

## Concepts for embodiment

* [Vizualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization)
* [Software art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art)
* [Net art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net.art)
* [History of Computer Art](http://iasl.uni-muenchen.de/links/GCA-VI.3e.html)
* [Code as performative speech act](https://monoskop.org/images/3/32/Arns_Inke_2005_Code_as_Performative_Speech_Act.pdf)

# Resources

A collection of libraries, code examples and papers that can serve to build CI-art pieces.

## Libraries

* [Network-synchronised metronome](https://github.com/chr15m/SyncJams) a library to synchronize several device with respect to a common pulse, over wifi. Can be useful to syncrhonize the CI event and the media displays.
* [Pure Data and openGL](https://github.com/Ant1r/ofxPof). A set of Pure Data (Pd) externals written with openFrameworks API, that bring OpenGL graphics and utilities to Pd.

## CodePen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io) is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers. It includes various visual effects that can be remixed for the hackathon. Here a few curated examples

* [Rain](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/oXmgJe). This pen served as a starting point for the [CI rain](https://travis.durieux.me/rain.html).
* [Infinite tree of life](https://codepen.io/ge1doot/pen/vOQZGG)

#Hardware bridges

Here is the code for the APIs to control actual hardware fixtures: lights and the organ.
