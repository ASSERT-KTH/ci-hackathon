# The KTH Continuous Integration Hackathon

> We build beautiful visualizations or sonifications of continuous integration (of compilation, test, analysis, packaging, deployment, etc). 

## The Concept

For months, we prepare our prototypes about CI data and activity. On October 14 2019, we meet in the nuclear reactor R1 at KTH for a unique moment of art and software technology.

## Participants

To participate to the hackathon, simply make a pull-request on this repo.

## Technology

We use Travis CI as main source  of data. Travis CI provides different API end-points to  listen to their builds. Reference documentation: <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/developer/>

In addition, CI artist Thomas Durieux provide a websocket server for easier use. Websocket URL: TODO [documentation]()

Suggestions:

* For visualization, [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) or [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
* For sonification, one can use the library [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
