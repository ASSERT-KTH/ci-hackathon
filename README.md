# The KTH Continuous Integration Hackathon

> We build beautiful visualizations or sonifications of continuous integration (of compilation, test, analysis, packaging, deployment, etc).

## The Concept

For months, we prepare our prototypes about CI data and activity. On October 14 2019, we meet in the nuclear reactor R1 at KTH for a unique moment of art and software technology.

[Learn more about continuous integration and the hackathon data](https://github.com/KTH/ci-hackathon/blob/master/site/travis.md).

## Participants

To participate to the hackathon, clone the repo, add a subfolder in the 'participants' folder, named with your github identifier(s) and simply make a pull-request on this repo. You will find more details about this in the [FAQ](https://github.com/KTH/ci-hackathon/blob/master/site/faq.md).

The list of current participating teams and their ongoing CI art projects is available [here](https://kth.github.io/ci-hackathon/#participants).

## Technology

The input stream of Travis CI continuous construction of open source software is provided through a websocket.

Hackathon participants can use different hardware and software technology to build pieces of CI art that render this continuous software activity.

Resources about these different technology are available in the [technology page](https://github.com/KTH/ci-hackathon/blob/master/site/technology.md)
