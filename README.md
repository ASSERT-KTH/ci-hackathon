# The KTH Continuous Integration Hackathon

> We build beautiful visualizations or sonifications of continuous integration (of compilation, test, analysis, packaging, deployment, etc).

## The Concept

For months, we prepare our prototypes about CI data and activity. On October 14 2019, we meet in the nuclear reactor R1 at KTH for a unique moment of art and software technology.

## Technology

### Travis API

We use Travis CI as main source of data. Travis CI provides different API end-points to listen to their builds. Reference documentation: <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/developer/>

### WebSocket

A websocket with Travis builds is available at <ws://travis.durieux.me>.

PYTHON: `pip3 install websocket_client`

```python
import websocket
def on_message(ws, message):
    print(message)

websocket.enableTrace(True)
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://travis.durieux.me/",on_message = on_message)
ws.run_forever()
```

JAVASCRIPT

```js
ws = new WebSocket('wss://travis.durieux.me’);
ws.onmessage = console.log
```

More information is available [here](https://github.com/KTH/ci-hackathon/blob/master/ci-ws-documentation.md).

### Travis Listener (NodeJS)

[Travis Listener](https://github.com/tdurieux/travis-listener) provides a websocket server for easier use ([documentation](https://durieux.me/projects/travis_listener.html))

### Visualization

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)

### Sonification

For sonification, one can use the library [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **I'm looking for partners, I'd like to create or join a team?**

  Simply create an issue on this repository and tell what you are looking for.

- **How do I add my information as a participant?**

   Yes, we also use Travis to construct this site. Basically, we walk trough our repo to catch every team and every solution by team, and then, we construct this site with the collected information. Just follow these instructions to register a team:
   1. Fork the project
   2. Create a folder inside "participants" with your team member github ids separated by underscore as a name, for example: ```id1_id2_...idn```.
   4. **Optional** Create a ```Readme.md``` file with the content that you want to show in your team page (By deafult we list your solutions and put them in an autogenerated file)
   3. Put any solution of yours in the previous folder
   5. **Options** We create a page for each solution, just create a ```Readme.md``` inside your solution folder and we will add it as a page in the site.
   6. Create a pull request to master
   7. And thats all !!.
   
- **Where is the hackathon happening?**

  The hackathon will take place in [reaktorhallen, a.k.a R1](https://www.r1.kth.se/). This is a very special place, 25 meters underground, where Swedish researchers had an experimental nuclear reactor and investigated nuclear physics from 1954 to 1970. In 1982, the reactor was completetely dismantled. Since 1998, the place is managed by KTH and used mainly for creative events, art exhibitions and installation, seminars and movie production. Over the years, among others, Madonna (the video [Nothing Really Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAVx9RKaLPU)), Moderna Dansteatern, Cullberg Ballet, Riksteatern, Radiokören and others have used R1 for different types of artistic projects.

- **What kind of equipment can I expect?**

We will provide access to:

   - light fixtures to have a ci-art light show. [More information about lights for ci-art](https://kth.github.io/ci-hackathon/lights.html).
   - an organ that can be controlled through a MIDI API. [More information about the organ MIDI API]().
   - a big screen to display pieces that are rendered on your laptop
   - speakers to play sound ci-art pieces
